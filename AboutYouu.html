                Hello, my name is Mateo Arango. I am 20 years old. I live in Medellin Colombia and I’m studying computer science
                 in the university is me to study my grade major. My father has a company a shipping company and he’s currently 
                 trying to develop some software to compete with the other companies and I like that idea so I first started studying
                  business engineering the tea carrier that it’s only here in Colombia and then I changed the computer science 
                  and now I’m trying to learn how to develop because I believe that in the future technology is gonna be more 
                  and more in the work business so and everything you know about it can help you challenges or experiences 
                  that shaped you into today well changing careers at the university hasn’t been easy for me, but I am slowly 
                  going to achieve it some project supply that I have when I graduate the university I would like to to leave 
                  the country and try and work some years in another country. I tried to leave the experience of living another 
                  culture see people and what I most enjoy about what I study is the challenge it has for me because you’re
                   nothing before I started so it’s like nice to to learn how machines work and when you now know a little 
                   bit more like you try to understand it, but you don’t know how to understand it so I believe that’s cool. 
                   Any sports I played soccer when I was little and now I play golf because I have a fractured knee so I cannot 
                   play contact sports and I also like to play paddle but because of the I cannot play imagine what I where I place 
                   in theory that is where literally I live because we party there and we play golf there and we can eat lunch there 
                   so which very enjoyable place I am. I am a person that is very introvert but when you get to know me and like pass 
                   that better I think I’m a fun guy that likes to have a fun time and bother a lot and enjoy enjoy life
                    dreams like I told you I would like to to live and work in another country for some years and my dream job is to 
                    come back here and work on my father‘s company and continue the legacy of the company. I have a brother that’s older 
                    than me so I believe that he’s gonna be the one that that stands up in the company, but I believe that there are space 
                    for the two of us and we can work there together
            </p>
