                <strong>Project 1: Personal Finance Tracker</strong><br>
                The Personal Finance Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their income and expenses efficiently.
                 The platform allows users to input their monthly financial data, automatically generating visual reports and charts that
                  track their financial progress over time. The goal of this project is to provide users with a clear and intuitive way to 
                  analyze their spending habits, identify trends, and make better financial decisions.
                
                <strong>Challenges & Learnings:</strong>
                
                During the development of this project, I focused on optimizing the performance of the charts,
                 ensuring they update in real-time as new financial data is added. One of the biggest challenges was designing a 
                 user-friendly interface that simplifies financial tracking for users with no prior budgeting experience. Through this project,
                  I deepened my understanding of full-stack development, data visualization, and user experience design.

                <strong>Project: Sustainable Women’s Activewear Startup</strong><br>
                This project focuses on developing a sustainable women’s exercise clothing brand with a mission to combine eco-friendly materials, 
                high-performance design, and a strong business strategy. The goal is to establish a startup that gains traction through branding, 
                sales, and community engagement, ultimately positioning it for acquisition by a larger company in the fitness or fashion industry.

                    Concept & Mission:
                    The brand is dedicated to creating stylish, functional, and environmentally sustainable workout apparel for women.
                     The activewear is designed for comfort, durability, and performance, while also reducing the environmental footprint 
                     of traditional fast fashion. The company’s core philosophy is “Sustainability Without Compromise”—offering high-quality 
                     workout gear without sacrificing ethics or functionality.
                
                <strong>Key Achievements:</strong>
                Product Line:
                    The collection includes:
