                Since I was little, I always loved to play soccer. I played at a competitive level until I was 13. 
                Now I donâ€™t play as much, but it will always be my favorite sport.

                Cars are another hobby that I enjoy. I love to drive.

                Golf is the sport that I play nowadays. Since I was a little kid, golf was always part of my life because my grandpa played and my father plays. Now my brother and I have started playing. We took lessons when we were little, but I stopped playing about 10 years ago and started again 2 years ago.
